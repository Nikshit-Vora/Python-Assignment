    "1. impact on Measures of central tendency:\n",
    "* Outliers, which are values that are much larger or smaller than the other values in the dataset, can pull the mean towards them and cause it to no longer represent the typical value of the data. \n",
    "* On the other hand, the median is less sensitive to outliers because it is not influenced by extreme values in the same way as the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Impact on Measures of dispersion:\n",
    "* Outliers can increase the range of the data, making it appear more spread out than it actually is. \n",
    "* The variance and standard deviation are based on the distance of each data point from the mean, so outliers can greatly increase these measures of dispersion."
